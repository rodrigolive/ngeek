NAME
    Ngeek - Nginx::Engine based PSGI/Plack web server

    WIP: half of the chunked tests and HTTP 1.1 are still failing.

SYNOPSIS
      # Run app.psgi with the default settings
      > ngeek
  
      # Or with plackup 
      > plackup -s Ngeek app.psgi

DESCRIPTION
    Ngeek is a PSGI perl web server that has unique features such as:

    High Performance
        Uses the fast XS/C HTTP header parser

    AnyEvent-style speed
        AnyEvent style connection handling, but done by the same Nginx
        engine we've grow to love.

    Multiple interfaces and UNIX Domain Socket support
        Able to listen on multiple intefaces including UNIX sockets.

    Small memory footprint
        Preloading the applications with "--preload-app" command line option
        enables copy-on-write friendly memory management. Also, the minimum
        memory usage Ngeek requires for the master process is 7MB and
        children (workers) is less than 3.0MB.

    PSGI compatible
        Can run any PSGI applications and frameworks

    HTTP/1.1 support
        WIP: Support chunked requests and responses, keep-alive and pipeline
        requests.

    UNIX only
        This server does not support Win32, but it all depends on
        Nginx::Engine.

PERFORMANCE
    Here's a simple benchmark using "Hello.psgi".

      -- server: Ngeek (workers=10)
      Requests per second:    6849.16 [#/sec] (mean)
      -- server: Twiggy
      Requests per second:    3911.78 [#/sec] (mean)
      -- server: AnyEvent::HTTPD
      Requests per second:    2738.49 [#/sec] (mean)
      -- server: HTTP::Server::PSGI
      Requests per second:    2218.16 [#/sec] (mean)

    This benchmark was processed with "ab -c 10 -t 1 -k" on MacBook Air 13"
    late 2010 model on Mac OS X 10.6.2 with perl 5.10.1. YMMV.
